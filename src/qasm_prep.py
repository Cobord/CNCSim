This module contains:

* Error classes: which characterize the different errors that can be raised if
  the input QASM quantum circuit (provided as a string) exhibits invalid properties.

* The QuCirc class: which describes a general QuCirc object characterized by the
  QASM string representing the quantum circuit. This means that an instance of this
  class (i.e. a specific quantum circuit) is defined by the provided QASM string.
  Once such an instance has been defined, the methods within the class can be applied to it.

The methods within this class are:

* Method 1: get_circuit_data(self)
            - This method processes the input QASM string provided by the user.
            - It formats the string by splitting it into lines and removing blank
              and commented lines.
            - It returns a list with all the relevant information in the QASM string,
              i.e., all the relevant information about the quantum circuit.

            - Summary: this method returns all the relevant information about the
              quantum circuit instance to which it is applied.

* Method 2: verify_input_circuit(self)
            - This method uses the information list produced by the previous method
              and verifies whether the input quantum circuit has a valid form. Namely,
              the circuit must:
                * have 1 qreg and 1 creg (a total of exactly 2 registers);
                * have at least 1 measurement;
                * be a Clifford+T circuit (only allowed operations are H, S, CNOT, T,
                  measure, and barrier);
                * have at least 1 T gate, otherwise it is a simple stabilizer circuit
                  (efficiently classically simulatable).
            - If the circuit is invalid, the method raises different errors depending
              on the condition that is not met.
            - If the circuit is valid, the method edits the list, changing the names of
              the quantum and classical registers to `q_stab` & `c_stab`, respectively.
              Then, the edited list, the number of qubits, the T-count, and the total
              number of measurements are returned.

            - Summary: this method either warns the user that the input quantum circuit
              instance is invalid or else (if the circuit is valid) it returns the properties
              of that instance.

* Method 3: msi_circuit(self, msi_clifford_file_loc, msi_clifford_file_name)
            - This method converts the Clifford+T circuit instance into a gadgetized
              (adaptive) Clifford circuit which is equivalent to the original one.
            - In doing so, it creates an auxiliary quantum register (`q_magic`) with
              as many qubits as the T-count and an auxiliary classical register (`c_magic`)
              for storing measurement outcomes.
            - Each T gate acting on a qubit in `q_stab` is replaced by a T-gadget,
              written in terms of a conditional "IF" statement.
            - It then exports the modified circuit (the adaptive Clifford circuit with
              magic state injection) to a new .qasm file.
